#### Other Cloud Platforms

For **Netlify**, **Railway**, or other platforms:

1. Deploy your repository
2. Set the environment variable `GREYNOISE_API_KEY` in your platform's dashboard
3. The application will automatically use live GreyNoise data when the API key is present

### GreyNoise Integration

This application integrates with GreyNoise to provide:

- **Live Threat Intelligence**: Real threats detected in the wild
- **IP Reputation Checks**: Instant lookup of IP address reputation
- **Automated Fallback**: Works with demo data if GreyNoise is unavailable

The GreyNoise API key is securely stored as an environment variable and never exposed in the client-side code.

### Vercel Custom Domain & Root Directory Setup

To deploy this project with your custom domain:

1. **Set the Root Directory:**
   - In your Vercel dashboard, go to your project‚Äôs settings.
   - Under **General > Root Directory**, set this to `cybersecurity-dashboard-2`.
   - This ensures Vercel deploys from the correct folder.

2. **Set up your custom domain (`salemcybervault.com`):**
   - Add both `salemcybervault.com` and `www.salemcybervault.com` in your Vercel project's domain settings.
   - Ensure DNS records point to Vercel (A record for root: `76.76.21.21`, CNAME for www: your Vercel domain).

3. **Verify Vercel and Google TXT records:**
   - Google site verification and Vercel TXT records must be present as shown in your DNS provider.

4. **Redeploy after changes:**
   - Trigger a new deployment to ensure changes take effect.

If you see a 404 error after deploying:
- Double-check the Root Directory in Vercel.
- Confirm your DNS records point to Vercel.
- Make sure your project files are inside the `cybersecurity-dashboard-2` folder.
- Check your deployment logs for any build or routing errors.
