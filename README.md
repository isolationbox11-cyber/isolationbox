### Vercel Custom Domain & Root Directory Setup

To deploy this project with your custom domain:

1. **Set the Root Directory:**
   - In your Vercel dashboard, go to your project’s settings.
   - Under **General > Root Directory**, set this to `cybersecurity-dashboard-2`.
   - This ensures Vercel deploys from the correct folder.

2. **Set up your custom domain (`salemcybervault.com`):**
   - Add both `salemcybervault.com` and `www.salemcybervault.com` in your Vercel project's domain settings.
   - Ensure DNS records point to Vercel (A record for root: `76.76.21.21`, CNAME for www: your Vercel domain).

3. **Verify Vercel and Google TXT records:**
   - Google site verification and Vercel TXT records must be present as shown in your DNS provider.

4. **Redeploy after changes:**
   - Trigger a new deployment to ensure changes take effect.

If you see a 404 error after deploying:
- Double-check the Root Directory in Vercel.
- Confirm your DNS records point to Vercel.
- Make sure your project files are inside the `cybersecurity-dashboard-2` folder.
- Check your deployment logs for any build or routing errors.
